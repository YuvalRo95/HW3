This web-based application allows users to step into the shoes of a zoo visitor, providing a unique interactive experience where they can explore various animal exhibits. Users can create their own visitor profiles and engage directly with the zoo environment by feeding different animals. The application is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring user-friendly interfaces and dynamic content to enhance the learning and entertainment value.
